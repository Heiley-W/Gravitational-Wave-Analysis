# Detecting Black Hole Mergers from Gravitational Wave Signals

This repository contains tutorials and scripts for generating and analysing **gravitational waveforms** using **PyCBC**, a widely used Python library in gravitational wave astronomy. All the steps are documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks, and more detailed explanations and theories can be found in the articles publised on Medium. 

**Main objectives**

• Match gravitational waves to theoretical waveforms, identifying black hole mergers

• Apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inference to estimate parameters of mergers
